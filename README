Dbtoria
===========
Version: #VERSION#
Date: #DATE#

Dbtoria is a cool web application.

You are looking at a template for creating a Qooxdoo application with
a Mojolicious backend. It is a classic "configure - make - install" setup.

Prerequisite
------------

Get a copy of the Qooxdoo sdk from www.qooxdoo.org.  If you followed the
"Quickstart" on https://github.com/oetiker/qx-mojo-app you are already set
with a copy of the Qooxdoo sdk in $HOME/sdk/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk.  In this case
immediately proceed with "Setup".

Setup
-----

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/dbtoria --with-qooxdoo-sdk=$HOME/sdk/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk

Configure will check if the necessary items are in place and give
hints on how to fix the situation if something is missing.

Development
-----------

While developing the application it is conveniant to NOT have to install it
before runnning. You can actually serve the Qooxdoo source directly
using the built-in Mojo webserver.

  cd frontend && make source
  cd backend/bin
  ./dbtoria-source-mode.sh daemon

You can now connect to the Mojolicious server with your web browser.

Installation
------------

To install the application, just run

   make install

You can now run dbtoria.pl in reverse proxy mode.

Packaging
---------

You can also package the application as a nice tar.gz file by running

   make dist

Learning
--------
