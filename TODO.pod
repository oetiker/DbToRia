=head1 NAME

DbToRia Development

=head2 DESCRIPTION

With the basic structure of DbToRia in place, there are still some
elements missing for a public release.

The following work packages are largely independent. They will lead to
a fully working DbToRia version with a feature set similar to that of
Gedafe, allowing drop-in replacement of Gedafe without modifications
to the database.

There will also be sample applications and software packages for
simple installation and testing.

The current project leader (PL) of DbToRia is Tobi Oetiker.
